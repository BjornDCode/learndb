# Why and when to use relational databases

Relational databases are very common and there are several reasons why companies chose a relation database over other database types

## Structure

Relational databases are structured. If a table has a 'name' column every record in the table will have an attribute called 'name'.

## Data integrity

Relational databases are specific about what kind of data they store, which format they store it in and when to reject a request to store data. This means you can be confident that the data stored is usable.

## Relationships

The nature of relational databases is that data is split into many tables. The idea of connecting tables together to form complex data models is a fundamental principle.

## Limited Redundancy

Data in a relational database is stored once. If another piece of data relies on this piece of data it will store a reference instead of copying the data. This makes it trivial to update data in one place and have it propagate throughout the system.
