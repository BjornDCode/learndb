# What is a relational database?

The relational database is the most commonly used type of database. It excels at binding together different pieces of data in a meaningful way. This is useful in many real world applications where a user might need lots of data to get use out of an application.

## Data in a relational database

A relational database will often consist of many different types of data. These can be referred to as relations. In a relational database relations are represented as tables. A table is simply a collection of all the instances of that relation in a system.

A relation that exists in many databases is a user. The system needs to remember who the users of the system are. Thus the database will have a 'users' table. Every user in the system is saved inside this table.

Tables can both represent single pieces of data (i.e. a user or a post) or bindings between multiple pieces of data. (i.e. this user is connected to this post)

## Example

If you have a Facebook account you will sign up to create an account. Your account will be saved as a user in the database so that the system knows who you are.

When you make a post on Facebook this will be saved in the database as a post. The system will also save information that connects your account in the database with the post.
