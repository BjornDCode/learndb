# Connecting to a database using PDO

## What is PDO?

PDO stands for PHP Data Objects. It's a PHP extension used to manage the connection to databases. It's an abstraction layer that unifies the API calls to different database systems.

To use it with a database management system software you need a PDO driver for that system.

## Create a PDO instance

In PHP, PDO is a [class](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php) that can be instantiated. It takes database details and login information as parameters in the constructor.

```
$db = "mysql:host='127.0.0.1';dbname='database_name'";
$user = "root";
$password = "root";

$pdo = new PDO($db, $user, $password);
```

After creating the PDO instance you will have a connection to the database.

To close that connection again do the following:

```
$pdo = null;
```

## Making queries

To make queries to the database you have to run methods on the PDO instance.

One of those methods are called `query`. It's used to run a simple SQL query.

```
$articles = $pdo->query('SELECT * from articles')->fetch();
```

You can also make pass parameters to the queries. This is useful if you are querying based on user input.

```
$category_id = 1;
$statement = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * from articles WHERE category_id = :category_id');
$articles = $statement->execute([ 'category_id' => $category_id ])->fetch();
```

When querying based on user input it's a good idea to use `prepare` and `execute`. This is because it manually escape the parameters and thus prevents SQL injection attacks.
