# 2nd normal form

A table is in 2nd normal form if it's 1st normal form and no non-prime attributes are dependant on any of on the candidate keys. Non-prime attributes in this context means it's not part of the candidate key. The candidate key are the combination of attributes that make the record unique.

We have a cars table with the following columns: id, brand, brand_country, model, color.

The candidate keys for the table are brand and model. Together they ensure that the record is unique since each brand can only have one version of each model.

| id  | brand   | brand_country | model   | color |
| --- | ------- | ------------- | ------- | ----- |
| 1   | Ford    | United States | Focus   | Black |
| 2   | Ford    | United States | Fiesta  | White |
| 3   | Peugeot | France        | 206     | White |
| 4   | Nissan  | Japan         | Qashqai | Black |

This table is not in 2nd normal form because of the following:

1. brand_country depends on brand
2. brand_country is a non-prime attribute because it's not part of the candidate key
3. brand is part of the candidate key

In order to achieve 2nd normal form it's necessary to split the table into 2 tables: brands and cars.

| id  | brand   | model   | color |
| --- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| 1   | Ford    | Focus   | Black |
| 2   | Ford    | Fiesta  | White |
| 3   | Peugeot | 206     | White |
| 4   | Nissan  | Qashqai | Black |

| id  | brand   | country       |
| --- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Ford    | United States |
| 2   | Peugeot | France        |
| 3   | Nissan  | Japan         |
