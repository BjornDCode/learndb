# 3rd normal form

A table is in 3rd normal form if it's in 2nd normal form and if all attributes are dependant only on the primary key.

The 2nd normal form dictates that non-prime attributes must not be dependant on the candidate key. The 3rd normal form dictates that non-prime attributes must not be dependant on other non-prime attributes.

We have a companies table with the following columns: id, name, industry, founder, founder_email.

The candidate keys for the table are name and industry because trademark laws dictate that a name can only be used once in an industry.

| id  | name         | industry    | founder       | founder_email     |
| --- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | AdScout      | Advertising | Mark Simpson  | mark@example.com  |
| 2   | FileSearchr  | Search      | Simon Campell | simon@example.com |
| 3   | Tech City    | Retail      | Mark Simpson  | mark@example.com  |
| 4   | Stock Ticker | Fintech     | Naomi Howard  | naomi@example.com |

In this case Mark Simpson is founder of two different companies. If he ever changed email it would be necessary to update multiple records to ensure the integrity of the data.

The table is not in 3rd normal form because of the following:

1. founder_email is a non-prime attribute
2. founder_email is dependant on founder
3. founder is a non-prime attribute

In order to achieve 3rd normal form it's necessary to split the table into two new tables: companies and founders.

| id  | name         | industry    | founder       |
| --- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1   | AdScout      | Advertising | Mark Simpson  |
| 2   | FileSearchr  | Search      | Simon Campell |
| 3   | Tech City    | Retail      | Mark Simpson  |
| 4   | Stock Ticker | Fintech     | Naomi Howard  |

| id  | founder       | email C           |
| --- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Mark Simpson  | mark@example.com  |
| 2   | Simon Campell | simon@example.com |
| 3   | Naomi Howard  | naomi@example.com |
