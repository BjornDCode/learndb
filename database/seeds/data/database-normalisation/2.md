# 1st normal form

A table is in 1st normal form if each attribute is atomic. Atomic in this context meaning that each attribute should only contain a single value.

We have a customers table with the following columns: id, name, email, address.

But in the application it's possible for a customer to have multiple addresses.

This would result in the following structure.

| id  | name           | email              | address                          |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1   | Mark Andreesen | mark@example.com   | Main Avenue 123                  |
| 2   | Howard Jacobs  | howard@example.com | Road Street 2, Avenue Passage 98 |
| 3   | Liza Andrews   | liza@examoke.com   | High Road 56                     |

In this example the 2nd record has multiple values stored in the address column. This is not atomic.

One way to solve this would be to simply add a second column for the next address.

| id  | name           | email              | address_1       | address_2         |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Mark Andreesen | mark@example.com   | Main Avenue 123 | null              |
| 2   | Howard Jacobs  | howard@example.com | Road Street 2   | Avenue Passage 98 |
| 3   | Liza Andrews   | liza@examoke.com   | High Road 56    | null              |

Now each attribute is atomic but it hasn't solved the problem. What if the customer has a 3rd address? Then we would have to add yet another column in the table.

To achieve 1st normal form we must instead ensure that each record has 1 value in each column and then create multiple records in the table if the application requires it.

| id  | name           | email              | address           |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1   | Mark Andreesen | mark@example.com   | Main Avenue 123   |
| 2   | Howard Jacobs  | howard@example.com | Road Street 2     |
| 3   | Howard Jacobs  | howard@example.com | Avenue Passage 98 |
| 4   | Liza Andrews   | liza@examoke.com   | High Road 56      |
