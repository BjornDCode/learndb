# Structure results

There are cases where it's useful to structure fetched data in a different way.

## Sorting

The `ORDER BY` command will order rows according to the specified columns. The `ASC` and `DESC` keywords can be used to specify the direction.

```
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age ASC;
```

This query selects all rows in the users table and order them by their age.

It's also possible to specify multiple columns it should order by.

```
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age, name ASC;
```

This query selects all rows in the users table and orders them by the age and name.

## Grouping

The `GROUP BY` command will group rows according to the specified columns.

```
SELECT * FROM users GROUP BY country;
```

This query will select all rows in the users table and group them by their country.

It's also possible to group by multiple columns.

```
SELECT * FROM users GROUP BY city, country;
```

The statement above will group each row by both the city and country columns.
