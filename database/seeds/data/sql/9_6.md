# Transactions

Transactions are useful when performing multiple operations at once. This could be creating multiple records in different tables that are related to each other.

If the second operation fails but the first record has already been added then the database would be in an inconsistent state.

To avoid this the operations can be grouped into a single transaction. If anything fails in any of the operations then none of them are performed. And if they all pass then the operations are run as normal.

Transactions solve another problem as well. If two different users are trying to perform an action on the same data at the same time there are lot's of possibilities of things to go wrong. The last query to be run might override the first query.

Transactions can communicate with each other so they can know if another transformation is happening to the data.
