# Triggers

Triggers allows developers to hook into the lifecycle of data changes in a database. At specific points in time code can be executed. The lifecycle events are:

-   Before `INSERT`
-   After `INSERT`
-   Before `UPDATE`
-   After `UPDATE`
-   Before `DELETE`
-   After `DELETE`

A good example of a use case for triggers is to enforce referential integrity. This means that we should also be sure that references to other tables are valid values. This is often the case when deleting a record that has a reference to another table.

Triggers can also override the action that is happening. That means it can take control of an insertion and ensure the data is valid or do other tasks before inserting.

In this example we want to listen for when new records are added to the users table. When a new user is added we also want to creating a team for them in the teams table.

```
CREATE TRIGGER create_user_team AFTER INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE create_team_for_new_users();
```
