# Views

Views are virtual tables that are generated based on a statement. It's a virtual table because it's not a regular table where rows can be inserted. Its records are the result of the statement that it's based on.

Views are good for when you have common queries that are run often. Creating a view can improve efficiency and can be more convenient to use because you can simply query all records of the view.

Views can also improve security because certain sensitive data can be omitted from records.

## Example

In this example we have a products table. One of the columns on the table is called featured. This is a boolean that represents whether the product should be shown in a prominent place in the application.

We can query for featured products:

```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE featured = 1;
```

Instead of having to repeat this query all over the application we can abstract it into a view.

```
CREATE VIEW featured_products
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE featured = 1;
```

Now we have a virtual table called featured_products. If existing products are being updated to be featured or if new featured products are added to the products table, the features_products table will automatically update accordingly.
