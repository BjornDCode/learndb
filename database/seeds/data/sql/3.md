# Create statements

The SQL command `CREATE` is used to created database primitives.

## Creating databases

The first thing to do is to create a database that can be used further on in the series.

`CREATE DATABASE learn_db`

This will create a new database with the name 'learn_db'.

## Creating tables

When we have a database we want to populate it with tables.

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id int,
    name varchar(255),
    email varchar(255),
    password varchar(255),
)
```

The statement above creates a new table with four columns: id, name, email and password. The `id` column is an integer type while the other columns are varchars. In this case it's a string that cannot be longer than 255 characters.

## Other types

The `CREATE` statement can also be used to create other things such as indexes, views and procedures. Examples of these will be showed later in the series.
