# SQL syntax

In this lesson we'll have a look at a basic SQL query.

```
SELECT name FROM users
```

`SELECT` means that we want to read data from the database. `name` means that we want to fetch the name attribute. `FROM` tells the database that we want to inform it where to look. `users` is the name of the table to look in.

Summed up this means that we want to fetch all rows in the users table but only fetch the name column for each row.
