# Joins

Up until now we've only ever queried data from a single table. With joins in SQL it's possible to return data from multiple tables that have a relation between each other.

There are several different types of joins that can be used. In these example there is a users table and a teams table. There is a one-to-one relationship between them.

## Inner join

Using an inner join will only return records where there is a connection between a row in one table and another row in another table.

```
SELECT users.id AS user_id, users.name AS user_name, teams.name AS team_name
FROM users
INNER JOIN teams
ON users.team_id = teams.id;
```

This query will only return records where users have a team_id attribute that matches a record in the teams table.

It will return an output that's something like the following:

```
| user_id | user_name | team_name      |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 2       | asbj1234  | Asbjorn's Team |
| 5       | asbj5678  | The Red Team   |
| 12      | mark_123  | Team Five      |
```

## Left join

The left join is similar to the inner join but there is a small difference. It will return all records from the left table even if doesn't have a corresponding row in the right table.

Using the example from above it would mean that user records could still be return even if they didn't have a matching row in in the teams table.

```
SELECT users.id AS user_id, users.name as user_name, teams.name as team_name
FROM users
LEFT JOIN teams
ON users.team_id = teams.id;
```

This could result in the following output.

```
| user_id | user_name  | team_name      |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| 2       | asbj1234   | Asbjorn's Team |
| 3       | tom_howard | null           |
| 5       | asbj5678   | The Red Team   |
| 12      | mark_123   | Team Five      |
| 14      | ashley     | null           |
```

Notice how there are some records from the users table that are returned here even though they didn't have a matching record in the teams table.

## Right Join

The right join is similar to the left join, but differs in that it returns records from the right table even if no match is found.

```
SELECT users.id AS user_id, users.name as user_name, teams.id AS team_id, teams.name as team_name
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN teams
ON users.team_id = teams.id;
```

This could result in the following output:

```
| user_id | user_name | team_id | team_name      |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 2       | asbj1234  | 1       | Asbjorn's Team |
| null    | null      | 3       | SQL Experts    |
| 5       | asbj5678  | 8       | The Red Team   |
| 12      | mark_123  | 9       | Team Five      |
| null    | null      | 12      | Fans of Joins  |
```

Notice how we get all records from the teams table now even though the team might not be attached to a user.

## Full join

The full join returns all records from both tables even though they might not have a corresponding row in the other table. This is doing both a left join and a right join at the same time.

```
SELECT users.id AS user_id, users.name AS user_name, teams.id AS team_id, teams.name AS team_name
FROM users
FULL JOIN teams
ON users.team_id = teams.id;
```

This query could return the following output:

```
| user_id | user_name  | team_id | team_name      |
|---------|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2       | asbj1234   | 1       | Asbjorn's Team |
| 3       | tom_howard | null    | null           |
| null    | null       | 3       | SQL Experts    |
| 5       | asbj5678   | 8       | The Red Team   |
| 12      | mark_123   | 9       | Team Five      |
| 14      | ashley     | null    | null           |
| null    | null       | 12      | Fans of Joins  |
```
