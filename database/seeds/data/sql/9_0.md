# Aggregate functions

Aggregate functions in SQL is a set of utilities that allows you to do simple calculations on data.

## Count

The `COUNT` function returns the number of rows that matches a query.

```
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM users WHERE age = 20;
```

This query returns the number of rows in the users table where the age has a value of 20;

## Average

The `AVG` function returns the average value of a column for all rows that matches a query.

```
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users WHERE country = 'Denmark';
```

This query returns the average age for all users in Denmark.

## Sum

The `SUM` function returns the summed value of a column for all rows that matches a query.

```
SELECT SUM(kids) FROM users WHERE country = 'Denmark';
```

This query returns the total number of kids for all users from Denmark.

## Min & Max

This `MIN` and `MAX` functions returns the smallest and largest value respectively of a column for all rows that matches a query.

```
SELECT MIN(age) FROM users WHERE country = 'Denmark';
```

This query finds the youngest age for all users in Denmark.

## Using with grouping and sorting

The aggregate functions are often useful to use when grouping or sorting a list of results.

```
SELECT COUNT(id), age FROM users GROUP BY age;
```

This query will group all rows in the users table by age and return the count for each age group.

```
SELECT COUNT(id), country FROM users
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC;
```

This query groups all rows in the users table by country and then orders the results based on the count.
