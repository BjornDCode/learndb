# Inserting records

The `INSERT` keyword is used to create new rows in tables.

You specify which table to insert into as well as which fields you are inserting.

Lastly you pass in the values that should be placed in the fields. This is done with the `VALUES` keyword.

```
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password)
VALUES ('asbj1234', 'test@example.com', 'password');
```

If you are filling out all the fields in a table then you can omit the fields specification.

```
INSERT INTO users
VALUES ('asbj1234', 'test@example.com', 'password');
```

## Multiple records

It's possible to insert multiple rows with one query. Simply pass in multiple lists of values.

```
INSERT INTO users
VALUES
('asbj1234', 'test@example.com', 'password')
('asbj5678', 'example@test.com', 'password');
```
