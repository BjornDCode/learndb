# Updating fields on tables

In the last lesson we saw how to create a table with columns. But it's often necessary to update tables as a system develops.

The `ALTER` keyword is used when updating tables or columns.

```
ALTER TABLE users
```

The statement above tell the database that we want to modify the users table. The following commands can then be used to do the actual modifications.

## Adding a column

Adding a column to a table can be done with the `ADD` keyword.

```
ALTER TABLE users
ADD birth_city varchar(255);
```

The statement above adds a new field called 'birth_city'.

## Deleting a column

Deleting a column on a table can be done with the `DROP` keyword.

```
ALTER TABLE users
DROP COLUMN birth_city;
```

This statement removes the field with the name `birth_city`.

## Updating an existing column

In addition to creating and deleting columns, it's also possible to update existing columns.

```
ALTER TABLE users
ALTER COLUMN description text;
```

This statement updates the description column with a new type. In this case it's now a text field.
