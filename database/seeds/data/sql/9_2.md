# Aliases

In SQL it's possible to assign temporary names to things like tables or columns. It's a temporary variable that can also be made up of values from multiple fields.

```
SELECT id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM users;
```

This query will return a list of records from the users table where each record has an id and a full_name attribute.
