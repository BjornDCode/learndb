# Updating records

The process of updating a single record and multiple records is the same. You first specify the table, then you specify which columns to update. Lastly you create a condition for which rows should receive this update.

To update a single record this condition should check the row's key and if updating multiple records it can be a more generic condition.

```
UPDATE users
SET email = 'new@email.com', password = 'new_password'
WHERE id = 2;
```

First we specify that we want to update rows in the users table.
Then we specify that the email and password columns should be update with new values. Lastly we specify that it should only be for the row with id 2.

```
UPDATE users
SET birth_country = 'Denmark'
WHERE birth_city = 'Copenhagen';
```

This example updates multiple records. Specifically it updates all rows with a birth_city that is Copenhagen.
