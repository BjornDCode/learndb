# What is SQL?

SQL, pronounced sequel, stands for 'Structured Query Language'. It's a declarative language used by many relational database systems. The user creates 'statements' or 'queries' in SQL that are run in the database. These queries can fetch, manipulate or insert data in the database.

## Sub languages

All commands in SQL are grouped into sub languages. Each language has its own purpose in maintaining the database system.

**DDL**: Data definition language. It's used to create primitive structures in a database such as the database itself and tables.

**DML**: Data manipulation language. It's used to interact with the data in the database. It can be used to read or update data. This is the one that's used by applications to work with data.

**DCL**: Data control language. Used to handle meta information about the database. This is especially related to database users and roles.

There are several other sub languages that won't be covered in this series.
