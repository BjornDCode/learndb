# Reading data

Fetching data from a database is one of the most common tasks. Similarly to deleting and updating records it works by specifying a table, fields to select and a condition.

```
SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 2;
```

This query fetches the name field on the row with id 2 in the users table.

```
SELECT email FROM users WHERE age = 21;
```

The statement above selects the email field on all rows in the users table where the row has an age value of 21.

## Fields

In the previous example we selected a single field from each row. It's also possible to select multiple columns in a row.

```
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE age = 21;
```

Lastly it's possible to use `*` as a wildcard to select all columns in each row.

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 21;
```
