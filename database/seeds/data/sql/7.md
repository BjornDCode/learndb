# Deleting records

To delete rows in a database is fairly similar to updating records. You specify a table to look for rows in and a condition that determines if a row should be deleted.

This means that to delete a single record you should check on the primary key in the condition while deleting multiple records can be done with a more generic condition.

```
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 2;
```

This specifies that we should look in the users table and delete the row with id 2.

```
DELETE FROM users WHERE activated = 0;
```

This query deletes all non-activated users in a database.
