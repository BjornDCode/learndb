# Data modelling

The data model of a system is a representation of all the data that will be persisted in the system. Data modelling is creating this data model.

It's a good way to plan what data the system will contain and how to structure it. A part of this process will also be to plan what data is connected through relationships and figuring out which relationship types to use.

Date modelling is usually done by creating diagrams. It's recommended to visualise it this way to get a better overview of the data model.

Usually the data model is created by a team of developers. When the entire team collaborates it makes sure there is consensus in the team on what data is needed and practical conventions like naming standards.

A good way to visually represent the data model is with ER diagrams.
